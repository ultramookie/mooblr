this is my script to backup *only* public text posts from tumblr.
i use it to backup my own blog on tumblr, just sharing if anyone
wants to do the same.

you'll need python and mysql to get this work. just create a database
and use the db creating file to create the table. cron for automatic
runs.

enjoy.
